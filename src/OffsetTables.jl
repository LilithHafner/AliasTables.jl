    Construct an `OffsetTable` from a `Memory` of `(probability, offset)` pairs.

    Callers are responsible for ensuring that

        probability_offset == OffsetTable(probabilities(_OffsetTable(probability_offset))).probability_offset

    i.e. that wherever they got the `probability_offset` from, it is a form that would be
    produced by the internal default construcors (which are subject to change).

    If callers fail to do this, then equality and hashing may be broken.
